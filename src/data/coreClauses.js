    Foreword:
      '<h1>Foreword</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>\n  <br> Continuous improvement in project delivery is required to build\n  confidence in the UK<br> construction sector so that we can attract\n  more investment. The Infrastructure and Projects<br> Authority (IPA)\n  is the governments centre of expertise for infrastructure and major\n  projects.<br> We sit at the heart of government, reporting to the\n  Cabinet Office and HM Treasury.<br> The application of the right\n  contract is central to the success of the overall project delivery<br>\n  system. The NEC suite of contracts has been in existence for over the\n  20 years and has linked<br> the projects, people and processes\n  together to create the correct environment for successful<br>\n  delivery.<br> This new and updated NEC4 contract embraces the digital\n  changes that are happening in the<br> construction industry,\n  especially around BIM, which I believe will be central to creating a\n  step<br> change in performance. Whilst looking forward it also builds\n  on the fundamentals required<br> for an effective contract.<br> The\n  use of NEC4 on public sector projects will help to deliver the\n  Government Construction<br> Strategy as we seek to improve central\n  governments capability as a construction client to<br> deliver\n  further savings in the order of 1.7bn across the Government estate.\n  The IPA looks<br> forward to collaborating with industry to make the\n  delivery of projects more efficient and<br> effective.<br> Tony Meggs,\n  Chief Executive, Infrastructure and Projects Authority</p>\n<p>\n  <br> Reporting to Cabinet</p>',
    Preface:
      '<p>NEC was first published as a new and innovative way of managing\n  construction contracts in<br> 1993  some 24 years ago. It was\n  designed to facilitate and encourage good management of<br> risks and\n  uncertainties, using clear and simple language.<br> The NEC approach\n  to managing contracts was endorsed in Constructing the team  The<br>\n  Latham Report, which was a government/industry review of procurement\n  and contractual<br> arrangements in the UK construction industry. This\n  led to a second edition in 1995<br> incorporating the further\n  recommendations of that review. This contract was used\n  increasingly<br> in the UK and overseas, and a major revision was made\n  with the third edition in 2005.<br> NEC has played a part in helping\n  the industry do things differently and better. It has done<br> so by\n  introducing effective project management procedures into the contract\n  itself. These<br> require pro-active management of risk and change,\n  and the day-to-day use of an up-to-date<br> programme. The range of\n  pricing options has given Clients flexibility in the allocation of\n  risk<br> and the ability to share risk and manage it,\n  collaboratively.<br> The NEC suite has evolved over three decades,\n  embedding consultation responses and user<br> feedback, and reflecting\n  industry development, including new procurement approaches and<br>\n  management techniques such as alliances, management of information\n  (BIM) and supply<br> chain engagement. This feedback and the new\n  procurement approaches formed the driver<br> for the development of\n  the next generation contracts and the launch of NEC4.<br> There were\n  three key objectives in drafting NEC4:<br>  provide greater stimulus\n  to good management<br>  support new approaches to procurement which\n  improve contract management and<br>  inspire increased use of NEC in\n  new markets and sectors.<br> It was to be evolution, not\n  revolution.<br> Some features of NEC4 include:<br>  a new design\n  build and operate contract to allow flexibility between construction\n  and<br> operational requirements in timing and extent<br>  a new\n  multi-party alliance contract based upon an integrated risk and reward\n  model<br>  new forms of subcontract to improve integration of the\n  supply chain.<br> Further enhancements include:<br>  finalising cost\n  elements during the contract<br>  incorporating a party-led dispute\n  avoidance process into the adjudication process<br>  increasing\n  standardisation between contracts and<br>  providing enhanced\n  guidance to give greater practical advice to users.<br> NEC has always\n  been known for its innovative approach to contract management, and\n  this<br> revision continues that approach. No other contract suite has\n  had such a transformative effect<br> on the built environment industry\n  as NEC. It has put the collaborative sharing of risk and<br> reward at\n  the heart of modern procurement. It is also unique in providing a\n  complete, back-toback<br> procurement solution for all works, services\n  and supplies in any sector and any country.<br> NEC4 continues to set\n  the benchmark for best practice procurement worldwide.<br>\n  <strong>Peter Higgins BSc (Hons), CEng, FICE<br> Chair of NEC4\n    Contract Board</strong>\n</p>',
